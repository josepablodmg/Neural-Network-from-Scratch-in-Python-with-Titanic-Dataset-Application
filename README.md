# Neural Network from Scratch in Python with Titanic Dataset Application

## Project Overview
Implementation of a fully connected feedforward neural network from scratch in Python using NumPy. This project demonstrates forward propagation, backpropagation, weight and bias updates, and applies the network to the Titanic dataset for survival prediction. The project provides a hands-on approach to understanding the fundamentals of neural networks without relying on high-level libraries.

## Features
- Sigmoid activation function and its derivative
- Feedforward computation for multiple layers
- Manual backpropagation algorithm for computing gradients
- Weight and bias updates for training
- Data normalization and preprocessing
- Evaluation of network predictions on the Titanic dataset
